module Herb
  class Engine
    # Compiles a template into Ruby that returns its dynamic values rather than its HTML.
    #
    # `Herb::Engine` answers "what does this template render". This answers "what did the template
    # evaluate to render it", which is the half that changes when state changes:
    #
    #     require "herb/engine/dynamics_compiler"
    #
    #     source = Herb::Engine::DynamicsCompiler.new(%(<h1><%= @title %></h1>)).src
    #     view.instance_eval(source)
    #     #=> { 0 => "Hello" }
    #
    # The names follow Phoenix LiveView, which splits a rendered template into its `static` strings
    # and its `dynamic` values for the same reason. A template's statics never change between
    # renders, so anything re-rendering on a state change only has to send the dynamics.
    #
    # This is a separate compiler rather than an option on `Herb::Engine` because that class is a
    # drop-in for `Erubi::Engine` and has to keep answering the way Erubi does.
    #
    # ## The shape follows the template, not the render
    #
    # Every insertion point owns an index, decided while compiling and the same on every render.
    # Control flow owns one too, because what it decided is itself a value that changes:
    #
    #     <% if admin? %><%= secret %><% else %><%= public %><% end %>
    #     #=> { 0 => { branch: 0, slots: { 1 => "s" } } }   when admin?
    #     #=> { 0 => { branch: 1, slots: { 2 => "p" } } }   otherwise
    #
    # Both branches keep their own indices, so a condition flipping changes which indices are
    # present and never what an index means.
    #
    # ## Absent means it did not run
    #
    # A key is missing when the code that would have filled it never ran, which is the same thing
    # the rendered markup says by not being there. Nothing has to be sent about a branch that was
    # not taken, and nothing can be learned about one either.
    #
    # A conditional and a collection are always present, because both are evaluated on every render
    # even when they produce nothing. A conditional that matched no branch is `{ branch: nil }` and
    # an empty collection is `{ rows: {} }`, both of which the client has to be told.
    #
    # ## Collections group by row
    #
    # A collection holds its rows in render order, each row carrying the slots inside it:
    #
    #     <% users.each do |user| %><%= user.first %> <%= user.last %><% end %>
    #     #=> { 0 => { rows: { 1 => { 1 => "Marco", 2 => "Roth" },
    #                          2 => { 1 => "Joe",   2 => "Doe" } } } }
    #
    # Grouping the other way would give one list per slot and leave the client to zip them back
    # together, which it cannot do once a row is inserted rather than appended.
    #
    # Rows are keyed by their position for now. Taking the key the template declares, through
    # `herb-key` or `id` or a `<%# herb:key %>` directive, is what makes a row survive being
    # reordered, and it belongs to `SlotVisitor` rather than here.
    #
    # ## Escaping
    #
    # A value carries the escaping of the place it was written, because that is where it is going
    # back to. The same expression is escaped differently in an attribute, in a `<script>`, and in
    # text, so the tree is left intact and the compiler decides as it normally would.
    #
    # ## Blocks
    #
    # A tag that takes a block, such as `<%= form_with do |f| %>`, is one entry holding everything
    # the block rendered. The helper decides where the block's output goes, so there is no position
    # in the template to attribute the pieces to.
